# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-guest-stars-in-the-Office-

Brief description of the project:

Netflix started in 1997 as a DVD rental service and has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex my data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. **In this project, I did some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and through some neat visualizations, I tried to find out if Netflix movies are getting shorter over time. **

The Office is my favorite show, which is why I was super excited to analyze the dataset! It started as a British mockumentary series about office culture in 2001 and has since spawned ten other variants across the world. Of all the iterations (including the original), the American series has been the longest-running, spanning 201 episodes over nine seasons. **In this project, I did some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. **

What did I apply to this project?

1. Data manipulation (everything from lists and loops) using Pandas
2. Data visualization using MatPlotLib



Conclusions: 
1. Netflix movies might not be decreasing in duration over time but rather, there is a wider spread of movies with varying duration as of this year.
2. It seems like viewership decreased drastically since Episode 125. It is very likely that this was around the time of Steve Carell's (Michael Scott) departure in the show. Looking at the scatterplot, we can also see an outlier - the most watched episode has 22.91 Million views! It features 3 guest stars - Cloris Leachman, Jack Black, Jessica Alba. 
If you are interested, this episode is called "Stress Relief" and is in Season 5.
